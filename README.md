# Brews_and_Weather - Web Application

## Description

This is a collaboratively designed website that helps people search for breweries by state. In case one wants to visit any of these breweries, the weather is also displayed for convenience purposes. We built this project not only to help people potentially plan for fun brewery trips, but it was a wonderful exercise on learning how third-party APIs work, how styling frameworks also work, and how Javascript is heavily utilized in displaying the data to the site.

This project includes the use of third-party-API's that fetch information and is displayed using Tailwind's styling framework. This project was extremely beneficial for us to also learn how git works in a collaborative format, and how pushing, merging, pulling, and resolving merge conflicts works. 
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
